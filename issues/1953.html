<P>According to 6.7.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.memory#3">intro.memory</A>] paragraph 3,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

A <I>memory location</I> is either an object of scalar type or a
maximal sequence of adjacent bit-fields all having non-zero
width. [<I>Note:</I> Various features of the language, such
as references and virtual functions, might involve
additional memory locations that are not accessible to
programs but are managed by the
implementation. &#8212;<I>end note</I>] Two or more threads
of execution (6.9.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.multithread">intro.multithread</A>]) can update and
access separate memory locations without interfering with
each other.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It is not clear how this relates to the permission
granted in 11.4 [<A href="https://wg21.link/class.mem#18">class.mem</A>] paragraph 18 to inspect
the common initial sequence of standard-layout structs that
are members of a standard-layout union.  If one thread is
writing to the common initial sequence and another is
reading from it via a different struct, that should
constitute a data race, but the current wording does not
clearly state that.</P>
