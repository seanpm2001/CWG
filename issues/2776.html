<P>Are there behavioral bounds in case an implementation limit is
encountered?  For example, a constant expression may fail to be
recognized as such due to an implementation limit (e.g. a recursion or
step limit), causing overload resolution to pick a different overload.
Is that acceptable?</P>

<P><U>Possible resolution:</U></P>

<P>Change in 4.1.1 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.compliance.general#2">intro.compliance.general</A>] paragraph 2 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Although this document states only requirements on C++
implementations, those requirements are often easier to understand if
they are phrased as requirements on programs, parts of programs, or
execution of programs <INS>as specified in the rules in
Clause 5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex">lex</A>] through Clause 33 [<A href="https://wg21.link/thread">thread</A>] and Annex
D</INS>. Such requirements have the following meaning:
<UL>
<LI class="ins">
<P>If a program contains a violation of a rule for which no diagnostic
is required, this document places no requirement on implementations
with respect to that program.</P>
</LI>

<LI class="ins">
<P>Otherwise, if an implementation limit (Annex B) is reached during
translation, an implementation shall reject the program.</P>
<P>
<I>Recommended practice:</I> An implementation should document
limits where they are known, and should issue a diagnostic in cases
where it can reasonably detect that the implementation limit is
reached.</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<DEL>If a program contains no
violations of the rules in Clause 5 [<A href="https://wg21.link/lex">lex</A>] through
Clause 33 [<A href="https://wg21.link/thread">thread</A>] and Annex D, a conforming implementation
shall, within its resource limits as described in Annex B,
accept and correctly execute [ Footnote: ... ] that program.</DEL>
</LI>

<LI>
<DEL>If a program contains a violation
of a rule for which no diagnostic is required, this document places no
requirement on implementations with respect to that program.</DEL>
</LI>

<LI>
Otherwise, if <DEL>a</DEL> <INS>that</INS> program contains a violation
of any diagnosable rule or an occurrence of a construct described in
this document as &#8220;conditionally-supported&#8221; when the
implementation does not support that construct, a conforming
implementation shall issue at least one diagnostic message.
</LI>

<LI class="ins">
Otherwise, a conforming implementation shall accept and correctly
execute that program.  [ Note: "Correct execution" can include
undefined behavior, depending on the data being processed; see

<P>Add a new paragraph after 4.1.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/intro.abstract#6">intro.abstract</A>] paragraph 6 as follows:</P>

If an implementation limit (Annex B) is reached, the behavior is
undefined.

<P>Change in 13.9.2 [<A href="https://wg21.link/temp.inst#16">temp.inst</A>] paragraph 16 as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

There is an implementation-defined quantity that specifies the limit
on the total depth of recursive instantiations (Annex B), which could
involve more than one template. <DEL>The result of an infinite recursion in
instantiation is undefined.</DEL>
